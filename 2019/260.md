# 260. Single Number III

## Ask

Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

Example:

Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
Note:

The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

## Answer

```Python
def singleNumber(nums: 'List[int]') -> list[int]:
    diff = 0
    for num in nums:
        diff = diff ^ num  
    diff = diff & (-diff) # 得到出diff最后侧不为0的位
    ret = [0, 0]
    for num in nums:
        if (diff & num == 0):
            ret[0] = ret[0] ^ num
        else:
            ret[1] = ret[1] ^ num
    return ret
```
